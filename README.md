# nuptOpenApi
RESTFul API service for NUPT

I started this project at early 2015. At that point, I must say that I was a very beginner of web programming. This project is written in PHP, it's too slow and too jumbled. To be honest, this code is a piece of s\*\*t. I uploaded the code here since someone think it would be helpful. I suggest you not to read this project cause it maybe confuse you.
